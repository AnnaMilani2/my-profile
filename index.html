					<p>
						I’m a first-year student at ESSEC Business School attending the Global Bachelor in Business Administration. I lived my entire life in Italy before moving to France for University, therefore I’m very close to my culture and its traditions. Nevertheless, I dream of exploring the world and getting to know as many new places as possible.

				<h2><strong>Volleyball</strong></h2>
					<p>I think it’s essential to exercise each week and I find it very enjoyable to do it through team sports such as Volleyball. You get to help each other out and <strong>I live for the adrenaline I experience during games.</strong></p>

				<h2><strong>Piano</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I started playing the piano when I was five years old because my mother always listened to <strong>Giovanni Allevi and Ludovico Einaudi</strong> and I always wanted to be able to replicate those sounds. During middle school, I also attended the Conservatory of Rome, after that, I just studied it for pleasure on my own.

				<h2><strong>Languages</strong></h2>
					<p>I have always wanted to learn as many languages as possible as it allows me to understand other cultures better. I can speak Italian, English, and French and I’m currently learning Japanese as I have always been fascinated by Asian countries and their cultures that are so different from what I’m used to.</p>
